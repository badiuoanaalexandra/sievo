The UI is responsive and it works on all modern browsers and mobile devices (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Android Chrome).

The project was built starting with “create-react-app”, afterwards “eject” command was executed to make everything local.

Libraries and tools:
- react
- redux – for handling state
- redux-saga – redux middleware for handling actions
- css3 with media queries – normally I would use scss, but this was a small project, so I decided to leave it out and just handle everything with normal css
- jest and enzyme for unit testing

The app consists mainly of the “src” folder, that has actions, assets, components, helpers, reducers and sagas and the “__tests__” folder on the same level as the src folder, which replicates the src structure for writing the tests.

Assumptions:
- fields that should be of type date have “date” included in the json field name
- dates and numbers will be displayed in the Finnish format

Features:
- sorting by project id
- searching based on the description field, search is case insensitive, the table updates while typing
- reset which clears the search field and disables the sort – it doesn’t re-fetch the projects
- to re-fetch the projects from the api refresh the page
- dates and numbers are displayed in Finnish format
- if values are too long to fit the cell they will be cut
- the UI updates on resizing the window or changing from portrait to landscape mode on tablets and mobiles

To start the project on local environment, open the NPM console, go to the app folder and run: npm start
To execute the tests run: npm tests (for watching changes) or npx jest for running all the tests.

The style.js file is auto-generated by the react-native module based on the style.css for each component and it is not in use at the moment.

There are currently 20 tests suites that contain 51 tests, which cover almost the whole application.
